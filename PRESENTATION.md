### Presentation Part 1 - RISC Architecture
***
### Introduction
In the early 1970s, John Cocke transformed computing by simplifying the 
set of instructions that tell computers which functions to perform. 
Cocke was the turing award winner of 1987. Cocke won this award for his significant contributions in the design and theory of 
compilers, the architecture of large systems and the development of Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC): 
for discovering and systematizing many fundamental transformations now used in optimizing compilers 
including the reduction of:
* Operator Strength
* Elimination of Common Subexpressions 
* Register Allocation
* Constrant Propagation
* Dead Code Elimination
***
### RISC Architecture
* Reduced Instruction Set Computers.

* The main idea behind this architecture was to make simpler hardware by using a reduced instruction set composed by a few basic step for loading evaluating and storing operations. 

* Although this is a reduced instruction set this approach tries to increase the CPU performance.

* Reduce the cycles per instruction at the cost of the number of instructions per program.

### Characteristic of RISC
* Simpler instruction 
* One word instructions.
* Instruction take a single clock cycle to get executed.
* More number of general purpose register.
* Simple Addressing Modes.
* Less Data types.
* Pipeline can be achieved.

### RISC Projects
John Cocke was involved in three RISC projects:
* IBM 801 machine (1974)
* Berkeley’s RISC-I and RISC-II processors (1980)
* Stanford’s MIPS processor (1981)
***
### IBM 801 machine
* IBM designed an experimental minicomputer named the 801. - *The name 801 comes from the building the project was housed in.*
* IBM used the resulting architecture in various roles out through to the 1980s.
* In the early-mid 1970s, IBM were interested in the possibility of constructing a telephone switch to handle a million cal per hour. 
* Their estimation was that this would require at least a 6 MIPS processor. 
* John Cocke and his group who were working on the project at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center.
