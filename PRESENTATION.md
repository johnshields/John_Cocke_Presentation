### Introduction
In the early 1970s, John Cocke transformed computing by simplifying the 
set of instructions that tell computers which functions to perform. 
Cocke was the turing award winner of 1987. Cocke won this award for his significant contributions in the design and theory of 
compilers, the architecture of large systems and the development of Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC): 
for discovering and systematizing many fundamental transformations now used in optimizing compilers 
including the reduction of:
* Operator Strength
* Elimination of Common Subexpressions 
* Register Allocation
* Constrant Propagation
* Dead Code Elimination
***
### RISC Architecture
John Cocke was involved in three RISC projects:
* IBM 801 machine (1974)
* Berkeley’s RISC-I and RISC-II processors (1980)
* Stanford’s MIPS processor (1981)
***
### IBM 801 machine
IBM designed an experimental minicomputer named the 801. IBM used the resulting architecture in various roles out through to the 1980s.
