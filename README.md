#### John Cocke the turning award winner of 1987...

John won this award for significant contributions in the design and theory of compilers, the architecture of large systems and the development of reduced instruction set computers (RISC); for discovering and systematizing many fundamental transformations now used in optimizing compilers including reduction of operator strength, elimination of common subexpressions, register allocation, constant propagation, and dead code elimination. [1]

#### John Cocke's work...

Cockeâ€™s first project at IBM was the Stretch Computer.  He soon became a specialist in large systems and made many advances in systems architecture and in compiler optimization. [2] 

In 1974, researcher John Cocke and his team at IBM Research began work on designing a controller for a telephone exchange. They wound up creating the first prototype computer employing a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture. The new architecture design enabled computers to run much faster than was previously possible, and is still used in nearly every computational device today. [3]
