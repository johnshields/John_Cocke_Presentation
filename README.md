## Research
#### John Cocke the turning award winner of 1987...
John won this award for significant contributions in the design and theory of compilers, 
the architecture of large systems and the development of reduced instruction set computers (RISC); 
for discovering and systematizing many fundamental transformations now used in optimizing compilers 
including reduction of operator strength, elimination of common subexpressions, register allocation, 
 constant propagation, and dead code elimination. [1]

#### John Cocke's work...
Cocke’s first project at IBM was the Stretch Computer. He soon became a specialist in large systems and made many advances 
in systems architecture and in compiler optimization.
In 1974, Cocke and his research team began an attempt to build a telephone switching network that could handle 
300 calls per second. 
In order to accomplish this, Cocke had to find a way to speed up the rate at which the system got its instructions.  
The systems were clogged up with instructions like “multiply,” which were rarely used but essential.  
Cocke decided to dismantle the more complicated instructions into simple, binary code, 
using logic and what he called “numerical tricks.” These simpler elements of instructions were stored in an “instruction cache” 
and were used piecemeal, as necessary, allowing the system to reach the same results as before but much more quickly.

Cocke’s Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) architecture, called the “801” after the building at the 
Thomas Watson Research Center at which Cocke was working, soon established itself as the industry standard.  
Cocke refined his system in the following years and played a key role in developing IBM’s RS/6000 in the 1980s. [2]

The new architecture design enabled computers to run much faster than was previously possible, and is still used in 
nearly every computational device today. [3]

Along the way, Cocke earned over 20 patents.  He also earned a reputation as an eccentric, 
whose enthusiasm for his work kept him – and any colleague he could find to share his ideas with – busy all day and all night.  
On the other hand, Cocke had little interest in mundane matters. He was famous for never cashing his paychecks, for example.

All agree that Cocke was a great inspiration to those who knew him or his work.  
In addition to his work on the RISC system, he made major contributions in logic simulation, coding theory, 
and other aspects of compiler optimization.  Although he called himself “fantastically lazy,”
John Cocke was a true giant of the history of computing and is one of the very few engineers to have won both 
the National Medal of Technology (1991) and the National Medal of Science (1994). [2]
